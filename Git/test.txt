there'll be no darkness tonight
lady our love will shine
just put your trust in my heart
and meet me in paradise
you're every wonder in this world to me
a treasure time won't steal away
so listen to my heart
lay your body next to mine
let me fill you with my dreams
i can make you feel so right
and baby through the years
gonna love you more each day
jackson michael
so i promise you tonight
that you'll always be the lady in my life
lay back in my tenderness
let's make this a night we won't forget
girl, i need your sweet caress
reach out to a fantasy
two hearts in the beat of ecstasy
come to me
and i will keep you warm
through the shadows of the night
let me touch you with my love
i can make you feel so right
and baby through the years
even when we're old and gray
i will love you more each day
